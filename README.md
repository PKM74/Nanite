# Nanite
Tiny OS that can run on X86 hardware off floppy disks or other media
Good luck reading my terrible X86 ASM and C
I work on this in my spare time,
I am designing it for older computers such as a i486 or i386 system i would recomend atleast a i586 (Pentium) however.
## Features
A Bootloader.
Thats it.
oh and a shell too.
also some tools for the FAT filesystem..
No kernel as of right now!!!
## How do I Test Builds?
Hardware tesing is done on a Pentium 2 @ 300MHz with 192MB of Ram (Panasonic Toughbook CF-27 MKII).
Testing is also done with QEMU and BOCHS!
