Very small OS that can run on X86 Hardware.
Fits on anything from a 320K Floppy to a 1.44MB Floppy (i however ONLY make 1.44MB Images, as i only have 1.44MB floppies).
Good luck reading my terrible X86 ASM and C (my C code is ok, x86 ASM however...).
I work on this in my spare time so don't really expect much work being done to it 24/7.
I am designing it for older computers such as a system i would recomend atleast a i686 CPU (Pentium 2 or better) however.
## Features
A funtioning Bootloader and half baked kernel.
Also some tools for the FAT filesystem (host system).
Kernel is currently INDEV.
## How do I Test Builds?
Early Hardware tesing was done on a Pentium 2 @ 300MHz with 192MB of Ram (Panasonic Toughbook CF-27 MKII).
It has now moved to my main laptop, a Dell Latitude D610, (2GB RAM, 1.6GHZ Pentium M).
Testing is also done with QEMU and previously BOCHS (not anymore cuz it almost crashes my system if I even think about running it).
## Thanks
Thanks to Nanobyte and the OSDEV wiki for providing resources for me to be able to make this.

And also a thanks to King Gizzard and The Lizzard Wizzard, without their music I highly doubt I would've made this.
